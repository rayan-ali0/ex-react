## Exercise: Fetching Country Data with React
#### <b>Step 1</b>: Setup your React application

Create a new React application using Create React App or any other method you prefer.

#### <b>Step 2</b>: Fetch Country Data

Fetch country data from the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/all) using the fetch or axios library. Retrieve information such as the country name, capital, population, and flag.

#### <b>Step 3</b>: Create a Component

Create a component called CountryInfo that displays the information fetched from the API for a specific country.

#### <b>Step 4</b>: Display a List of Countries

Create another component called CountryList that displays a list of countries. Each country should be a clickable item that, when clicked, displays the country information using the CountryInfo component.

#### <b>Step 5</b>: Style the Components

Apply some basic CSS to style the components and make the application visually appealing.

#### <b>Step 6</b>: Error Handling

Implement error handling for cases where the API request fails or the data isn't available.

Feel free to customize the exercise, add more features, or structure the components in a way that makes sense to you. Good luck with your coding!
